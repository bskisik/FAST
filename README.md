# FAST  

![fast_index](docs/img/fast_index_page.png)  

**FAST** is an end-to-end and unsupervised earthquake detection pipeline. It is a useful tool for seismologists to extract more small earthquakes from continuous seismic data. FAST is able to run on different machines by using Google Colab, Linux, or Docker.  

* To run FAST with Google Colab, click [here](https://ttapparo.github.io/FAST/setup_colab/) for the tutorial.  

* To run FAST with Linux, click [here](https://ttapparo.github.io/FAST/setup_linux/) for the tutorial.  

* To run FAST with Docker, click [here](https://ttapparo.github.io/FAST/setup_docker/) for the tutorial.  

Check out the [user guide](https://ttapparo.github.io/FAST/) to learn more about FAST and how to use it on your own dataset.
