# FAST  

![fast_index](docs/img/fast_index_page.png)  

FAST is an end-to-end and unsupervised earthquake detection pipeline. It is a useful tool for seismologists to extract more small earthquakes from continuous seismic data.  

FAST is able to run on different machines by using Google Colab, Linux, or Docker.  

To run FAST with Google Colab, click [here](https://ttapparo.github.io/FAST/setup_colab/) for the tutorial.  

To run FAST with Linux, click [here](https://ttapparo.github.io/FAST/setup_linux/) for the tutorial.  

To run FAST with Docker, click [here](https://ttapparo.github.io/FAST/setup_docker/) for the tutorial.
