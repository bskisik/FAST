# New Zealand, Year 2010  

!!! info
    The objective of this study is to detect small earthquakes in New Zealand to test earthquake triggering hypothesis. Detection results, with input parameters, are described in Rong et al. [2018]. 1 year continuous data (2010), 5 seismic stations LTZ, MQZ, KHZ, THZ, OXZ (Figure 16, black triangles), vertical components only, sampled at 100 Hz. Detections were compared against the GeoNet catalog, and visually inspected. FAST detected 11419 events: 4916 catalog events (Figure 16, red circles), 355 teleseismic events, 6123 new local earthquakes and 25 false positives (noise waveforms).
