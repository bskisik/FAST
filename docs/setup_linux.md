# **Installation for Linux**

## **Requirements**

FAST is written in Python and C++ and is designed to run on Linux clusters.  

Install instructions might not work for Windows and macOS machines. Refer to the installation instructions for [Google Colab](setup_colab.md) or [Docker](setup_docker.md) if you want to run FAST on a machine other than Linux.  

The code will benefit from running on machines with more memory and CPUs.  

* Consider using instances from Amazon AWS or Google Cloud  

## **Install FAST**

Clone the FAST repository from GitHub into a local directory named `./FAST/`
```
(base) ~$ git clone https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/FAST.git ./FAST/
```  

Install utilities (if not already installed)
```
(base) ~$ sudo apt-get install -y wget
(base) ~$ sudo apt-get install -y jq
```  

Install C++ dependencies
```
(base) ~$ sudo apt-get install -y cmake
(base) ~$ sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
(base) ~$ sudo apt-get install -y libboost-all-dev
```

Install Python dependencies in the `eq_fast` conda environment
This requires having [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) already installed on your computer
```
(base) ~$ cd FAST/
(base) ~/FAST$ conda env create -f environment.yml -n eq_fast
```  

Activate `eq_fast` conda environment before running FAST
```
(base) ~/FAST$ conda activate eq_fast
(eq_fast) ~/FAST$
```

## **Run FAST**

Refer to the [Tutorial](tutorial.md) for more detailed information about FAST parameters, inputs, and outputs.

### Dataset

Raw SAC files for each station are stored under `data/waveforms${STATION}`. Station "HEC" has 3 components so it should have 3 time series data files; the other stations have only 1 component.  

### Fingerprint  

Parameters for each station are under `parameters/fingerprint/`. To fingerprint all stations and generate the global index, you can call the wrapper script (Python):  

```
(eq_fast) ~/FAST$ python run_fp.py -c config.json
```  

An alternate option for the fingerprint wrapper script (bash):

```
(eq_fast) ~/FAST$ cd fingerprint/
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/fingerprint$ ../parameters/fingerprint/run_fp_HectorMine.sh
```  

The fingerprinting step takes less than 1 minute per waveform file on a 2.60GHz CPU.

The generated fingerprints can be found at `data/waveforms${STATION}/fingerprints/${STATION}${CHANNEL}.fp`.

The json file `data/waveforms${STATION}/${STATION}_${CHANNEL}.json` contains information about the fingerprint file, including number of fingerprints (`nfp`) and dimension of each fingerprint (`ndim`).

To fingerprint a specific channel/station, call the fingerprint script with the corresponding fingerprint parameter file (this is one line from `run_fp_HectorMine.sh`):

```
(eq_fast) ~/FAST$ cd fingerprint/
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/fingerprint$ python gen_fp.py ../parameters/fingerprint/fp_input_CI_CDY_EHZ.json
```  

In addition to generating fingerprints, the wrapper script calls the global index generation script automatically. The global index (as opposed to index with a single component) is a consistent way to refer to fingerprint times at different components and stations. Global index generation should only be performed after you've generated fingerprints for every component and station that is used in the detection:  

```
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/fingerprint$ python global_index.py  ../parameters/fingerprint/global_indices.json
```  

The resulting global index mapping for each component is stored at `data/global_indices/${STATION}_${CHANNEL}_idx_mapping.txt`, where line i in the file represents the global index for fingerprint i-1 in this component.  

### Similarity Search  

Compile and build the code for similarity search:  

```
(eq_fast) ~/FAST$ cd simsearch
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/simsearch$ cmake .
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/simsearch$ make
```  

Call the wrapper script to run similarity search for all stations:  

```
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/simsearch$ cd ..
(eq_fast) ~/FAST$ python run_simsearch.py -c config.json
```  

An alternate option for the similarity search wrapper script (bash):

```
(eq_fast) ~/FAST$ cd simsearch/
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/simsearch$ ../parameters/simsearch/run_simsearch_HectorMine.sh
```

To run the similarity search for each channel/station individually:

```
(eq_fast) ~/FAST$ cd simsearch/
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/simsearch$ ../parameters/simsearch/simsearch_input_HectorMine.sh CDY EHZ
```  

### Postprocess: Parse FAST Similarity Search Output

The following scripts parse the binary output from similarity search to text files, and combine the three channel results for station HEC to a single output. Finally, it copies the parsed outputs to directory `../data/inputs_network/`.

```
(eq_fast) ~/FAST$ cd postprocessing/
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/postprocessing$ ../parameters/postprocess/output_HectorMine_pairs.sh
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/postprocessing$ ../parameters/postprocess/combine_HectorMine_pairs.sh
```  

### Postprocess: Network detection

```
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/postprocessing$ python scr_run_network_det.py ../parameters/postprocess/7sta_2stathresh_network_params.json
```  

Results from the network detection are under `data/network_detection/7sta_2stathresh_detlist*`. The file contains a list of potential detections including information about starting fingerprint index (global index, or time) at each station, number of stations where we found other events similar to this event (`nsta`), total number of similar fingerprint pairs mapped to the event (`tot_ndets`), total sum of the similarity values (`tot_vol`). Detailed format of the output can be found in the user guide.

### Postprocess: Clean Network Detection Results
Need to modify inputs within each script file to your data set.

```
(eq_fast) ~/FAST$ cd utils/network/
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/utils/network$ python arrange_network_detection_results.py
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/utils/network$ ./remove_duplicates_after_network.sh
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/utils/network$ python delete_overlap_network_detections.py
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/utils/network$ ./final_network_sort_nsta_peaksum.sh
```  

The results from the above scripts can be found at `data/network_detection/sort_nsta_peaksum_7sta_2stathresh_FinalUniqueNetworkDetectionTimes.txt`

The above section only works with detection results with ^^multiple stations^^. For single station detections, you can parse the results in the ==output file==. The schema of the output file is: event_start (starting fingerprint index), event_dt, ndets (total number of event-pairs that include this event), peaksum (peak total similarity), and volume (sum of all similarity values for all event-pairs containing this event). Large peaksums usually correspond to higher confidence.  

### Visualize the FAST Output

```
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/utils/network$ cat ../../data/network_detection/sort_nsta_peaksum_7sta_2stathresh_FinalUniqueNetworkDetectionTimes.txt
```

### Display Waveforms for FAST Detections in Descending Order of "peaksum" Similarity

This example outputs png images for 100 event waveforms. The plot file names are sorted in descending order by: `num_sta` (number of stations that detected this event), `peaksum` (peak total similarity)

```
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/utils/network$ cd ..
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/utils$ cd events/
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/utils/events$ python PARTIALplot_detected_waveforms_HectorMine.py 0 100
```

    event_rank00001_nsta7_peaksum1015_ind3842_time3842.0_1999-10-15T14:04:02.676000.png
    event_rank00002_nsta7_peaksum920_ind7488_time7488.0_1999-10-15T15:04:48.676000.png
    event_rank00003_nsta7_peaksum823_ind5286_time5286.0_1999-10-15T14:28:06.676000.png
    event_rank00004_nsta7_peaksum718_ind20202_time20202.0_1999-10-15T18:36:42.676000.png
    event_rank00005_nsta7_peaksum713_ind46536_time46536.0_1999-10-16T01:55:36.676000.png
    ...
    ```

Similarly, to plot results for single station detection, we need a global start time (t0) from global_idx_stats.txt, dt_fp in seconds:  

* Event time = t0 + dt_fp * (start fingerprint index)

### Set Detection Threshold

!!! note
    Everything above the detection threshold is deemed an earthquake. In this example, the first 50 events with the highest "peaksum" similarity are identified as earthquakes, while the remaining events are not earthquakes.

```
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/utils/events$ cd ../../data/network_detection/
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/data/network_detection$ head -50 sort_nsta_peaksum_7sta_2stathresh_FinalUniqueNetworkDetectionTimes.txt > EQ_sort_nsta_peaksum_7sta_2stathresh_FinalUniqueNetworkDetectionTimes.txt
```

### Output Final FAST Detected Event List

```
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/data/network_detection$ cd ../../utils/events/
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/utils/events$ python output_final_detection_list.py
(eq_fast) ~/FAST/utils/events$ cat ../../data/network_detection/FINAL_Detection_List_HectorMine_7sta_2stathresh.txt
```
