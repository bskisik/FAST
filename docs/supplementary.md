## **Why detect small earthquakes?**

- More common than large earthquakes
    * More data about subsurface

- Monitor earthquake activity over extended time periods: anything unusual?
    * Earthquake swarms (volcanic areas; near big faults)
    * Industry applications (oil/gas, geothermal, mining) with potential for induced earthquakes)

- Inform seismic hazard estimates
    * Illuminate active faults, dimensions, geometry
    * Identify previously unknown faults
