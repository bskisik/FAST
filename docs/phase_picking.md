# Phase Picking  

We use the final detection list from FAST to cut the .sac files based on the detected times. These cut files are the input for the `run_seisbench.py` script to pick phases automatically with machine learning models.  

SeisBench is an open-source python toolbox for machine learning in seismology. Learn more about SeisBench [here](https://seisbench.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
